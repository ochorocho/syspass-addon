In sysPass go to `User and Accesses -> Api Authorizations` and add permissions for

* "Search for Accounts"

:warning: Both have to have the same password

In Firefox go to the Addons page (cmd+shift+A / `about:addons`) and edit sysPass Addon settings. Add URL (https required), API token and API password.
